## 💬 The Problem

Even in today's digital world, local communities often remain disconnected.  
Here’s what we noticed:

- 🚫 Local issues go unnoticed  
- 🚫 We miss important neighborhood updates  
- 🚫 No central platform to talk to nearby residents  
- 🚫 Emergency contacts are scattered  
- 🚫 No easy way to sell, donate, or ask for help locally  

This disconnect inspired us to build **TownSquare** — a platform that connects people living in the same area like never before.
